    The company's first product, the SegwayÂ® Personal Transporter (PT), was the first two-wheeled, 
    self-balancing, electric transportation device to use our patented dynamic stabilization technology.

    are redefining personal transportation for consumers and businesses. Segway works with 
    commercial and municipal organizations to realize the benefits of zero-emission personal 
    transportation that increase productivity and utilize existing infrastructure.
