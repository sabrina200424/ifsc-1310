      Simply Moving
  </h1>

  <p> Segway is passionately devoted to moving you- easily, efficiently, intelligently simple. 
    The company's first product, the SegwayÂ® Personal Transporter (PT), was the first two-wheeled, 
    self-balancing, electric transportation device to use our patented dynamic stabilization technology. 
</p>

<p> Today, Segway is focused on serving our customers by developing safe, unique products that 
    are redefining personal transportation for consumers and businesses. Segway works with 
    commercial and municipal organizations to realize the benefits of zero-emission personal 
    transportation that increase productivity and utilize existing infrastructure. 
</p>

<p> Together with our customers, we help government leaders create the framework to adopt
     these new technologies and safely and wisely integrate them into society. For our 
     investors and dealers, we create successful new business opportunities with an exciting
      roadmap to the future.
</p>

<p> We continue to focus our research and development efforts on creating versatile, agile,
     short-range devices that utilize the patented dynamic stabilization technology and advanced
      alternative-power systems. We strive to make every product we build as exhilarating as
       our flagship product, the Segway PT, in order to excite and keep people on the move.
