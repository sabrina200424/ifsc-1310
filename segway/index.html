  Concept Centaur
</h3>

<p>
  Like the mythical half-horse, half-man of Greek lore, Concept Centaur 
  combines the best of several technologies to create an innovative whole. 
  The result of exploration by Segway Inc.'s product development team, 
  Concept Centaur will challenge the way you think about four-wheeled transportation.
</p>

<p>
  From time to time Segway's product development team devotes days, or even weeks, 
  to creating new product concepts with the goal of finding a prince among frogs. 
  It's a product exploration process they call "frog kissing." During this time, engineers 
  and designers are encouraged to use any available materials in a very short time frame to 
  prove a concept will work.
</p>

<p>
  The product development team demonstrated that Concept Centaur was a princeâ€”a concept 
  that passed this initial feasibility test, but is not yet ready to become a product. 
  Concept Centaur demonstrates Segway's continued commitment to breakthrough innovation
  and the innumerable possibilities for the future of personal transportation.

<h3>
  What is the Centaur?
</h3>

<p>
  Concept Centaur combines proprietary dynamic stabilization technology with advanced
   propulsion and suspension systems, and an intuitive user interface to create a unique
    four-wheel device that is easily controllable on two or four wheels. Its full suspension
     and aggressive rider positioning provide an exhilarating ride for one or two people
      while maintaining control over a variety of terrain. Its rugged performance, zero 
      emissions, and quiet operation make it a good low-impact way to explore the world.
       Its power and versatility make it suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor 
       recreational and commercial applications.

    Pop a wheelie: The Centaur uses dynamic stabilization technology to limit and/or maintain
     the angle at which the rider experiences the device. What would normally be a dangerous 
     maneuver on a motorcycle or ATV becomes safe and controlled on the Centaur. In addition,
      the rider can position his/her body in three different ways, which makes for a fun ride.
       This technology also allows for a high-performance design with a short, compact wheelbase
        - a combination that traditionally can be very difficult to control.

    Lean forward, go forward: If you've haven't yet experienced the Segway PT, now is the time. 
    If you have, you know what we mean by intuitive controls. Concept Centaur uses dynamic 
    stabilization in a similar way. When on two wheels, the Centaur is controlled by how the 
    rider shifts his or her weight. To go forward, lean forward. To go back, lean back.
